# workplanner
This application allows a user to schedule/plan their workday. The planner has hourly inputs from 8am to 6pm for users to type in their plans and click the "save" button. The "save" button includes an on.click function which saves the user's text input to local storage and prevents the input from erasing after they refresh the page. This app also displays the current time for the user to make their planning easier.
